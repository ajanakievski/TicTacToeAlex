A TicTacToe game
You are required to implement a fully-functioning version of TicTacToe
- It is a 2-player game (no computer opponent, playing in the same device) // DONE
- Before each round the players are asked for their names// Players are asked for their names on first lounch and if they choose to reset the game by clicking the icon on the bottom left corner - hope this wont get me less points :)
- Players switch after every turn // Players turn is indicated with a red arrow (did you mean after the round they should swith from x to O)? Should i do this?
- Once a round is finished, the winner (or draw) will be displayed on a leaderboard // Game has nice score tracking, i had message box displaying on each round, but i think its too much so decided to leave them out (code is there only comented)

+1 if you use storyboards // DONE + used constrains - thous game can run on all apple devices (iPad/iPhone)
+1 if you write tests // really didint have time to learn this
+1 if you document your code // DONE

Requirements
- You are required to use git for versioning (link the code on your Github/Bitbucket account)
- Feel free to use any 3rd party code to help you get the task done more effectively (this must be documented) // Used code for deciding win situation, all the other code is mine
- iPhone5 or higher is used as testing device // Game looks good on any iPhone... on iPad its bit small with a lot of wasted space (apple recomends using deferent storyboards for iPad, but didnt have time to do this).
